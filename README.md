# Cat vs Dog Image Classifier

## Overview
This project is a deep learning-based image classification model that distinguishes between images of cats and dogs. The classifier is built using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and trained on a dataset containing labeled images of cats and dogs.

## Features
- Uses a CNN model for image classification
- Trained on a dataset of cat and dog images
- Achieves high accuracy in distinguishing between cats and dogs
- Deployed using a user-friendly interface for image prediction

## Technologies Used
- Python
- TensorFlow/Keras
- OpenCV
- NumPy, Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Streamlit (for deployment)

## Dataset
The dataset used consists of labeled images of cats and dogs, typically sourced from publicly available datasets like Kaggle's "Dogs vs. Cats" dataset.

## Installation
To set up the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cat-vs-dog-classifier.git
   cd cat-vs-dog-classifier
   ```
2. Run the deployment script:
   ```sh
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

## Usage
- Upload an image of a cat or dog through the web interface.
- The model will predict whether the image contains a cat or a dog.
- The result will be displayed with a confidence score.

## Results
The model achieves a high accuracy in distinguishing between cats and dogs. Performance metrics and evaluation details are included in the project.

## Future Improvements
- Improve model accuracy with advanced architectures
- Implement transfer learning for better generalization
- Deploy as a cloud-based API
